	Abstract-Prior to the innovation of information communication technologies (ICT), social interactions
evolved within small cultural boundaries such as geo spatial locations. The recent developments of communication
technologies have considerably transcended the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional
communications. These social technologies have created a revolution in user-generated information, online
human networks, and rich human behavior-related data. However, the misuse of social technologies such as
social media (SM) platforms, has introduced a new form of aggression and violence that occurs exclusively
online. A new means of demonstrating aggressive behavior in SM websites are highlighted in this paper. The
motivations for the construction of prediction models to ght aggressive behavior in SM are also outlined.
We comprehensively review cyberbullying prediction models and identify the main issues related to the
construction of cyberbullying prediction models in SM.</p>
